        <h3><a name="RM">RM-Kim Namjoon</a></h3>
        <p>RM (whose full name is Kim Namjoon) is the band's leader and main rapper. Born on Sept. 12, 1994, RM grew up in Ilsan, South Korea, and began rapping at a young age. He made some waves in the underground rap scene — performing under various names, including Large, Stealo and Runch Randa — and eventually caught the eye of the South Korean record label Big Hit Entertainment (later rebranded into HYBE), who formed BTS and recruited him to be the first official member in 2010.</p>

        <p>Over the years, RM has been praised for his fluency in English. During an appearance on The Ellen Degeneres Show, RM revealed that he taught himself English by watching the iconic sitcom Friends. "My English teacher was the sitcom Friends," he explained. "Back in the days, when I was like 15, 14, it was quite like a syndrome for all the Korean parents to make their kids watch Friends. I thought I was kind of like a victim at that time, but right now, I'm the lucky one, thanks to my mother."</p>
            
        <p>RM added that his mom bought him all 10 seasons of the hit show on DVD. "So firstly, I watched them with the Korean subtitles, and then next time, I watched with the English subtitles, and then I just removed it."</p>
            
        <p>During their annual FESTA dinner in June 2022, BTS shared that they would be taking a break to pursue solo projects and figure out their next steps as a band.</p>
            
        <p>"I always thought that BTS was different from other groups, but the problem with K-pop and the whole idol system is that they don't give you time to mature," RM said during the event. "You have to keep producing music and keep doing something."</p>
            
        <p>HYBE later clarified in a statement that the group was not taking a hiatus and would remain active "as a team while taking individual journey to further achieve personal growth."</p>
            
        <p>RM made his official solo debut with his first studio album, INDIGO, in December 2022.</p><br />

        <p>During an interview with Weverse Magazine, Jin opened up about finding his confidence as an individual, outside of BTS.</p>
            
        <p>"It used to be that any time I had to do something, I thought it was such a big deal. Like, how can I handle something this big right now," Jin told the outlet. "I would always feel discouraged, but my personality has changed a lot now, I think. I think the biggest change in my mind is that now, even if there's a major project in the works, I think I can do it now."</p>
            
        <p>He added, "Now, instead of, 'How can I handle this?' it's 'I can handle this!' when I'm making songs for other people to listen to."</p>
            
        <p>Jin released the solo single, "The Astronaut," which was co-written by Chris Martin of Coldplay, in October 2022.</p><br />
