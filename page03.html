            <li><b>Dynamite</b></li>
            <p>As if any of us needed another reason to love BTS, the Bangtan Boys gave us a single that helped us briefly forget about the dumpster fire that was 2020. When “Dynamite,” their first all-English song, dropped in August of last year, it immediately broke records…and it still is! In honor of them nabbing a Grammy nomination for “Dynamite” and performing it at the ceremony this year—and also in honor of me needing to talk about them at least once per day—it’s time to break down the feel-good lyrics.</p>
            <p>But most importantly, the song is meant to unite and be a gift to help fans get through this year. During an interview with Zane Lowe, RM described “Dynamite” as being “made of positive vibes, energy, hope, love, the purity, everything.” He continued, “Recording this song was really fun, and like Jin said, we’re going through difficult times so we tried to have more fun working on this song. We made this song in hopes of giving energy to the listeners. We’re glad this song turned out great and hope a lot of our fans can listen to it to receive the positive energy we tried to incorporate in the song.”</p>
            <p><mark>"Dynamite"</mark> was met with mostly positive reviews from music critics upon release, with emphasis on its catchiness and broadly appealing retro sound.</p><br />

            <li><b>Spring Day</b></li>
            <p>February 13th, 2022: it’s the 5th anniversary of the release of “Spring Day” by BTS. If you watch and listen closely, this song is always mentioned in conversations when talking about BTS’ music and their phenomenal discography. To others who are not familiar, it might seem strange to learn this is a b-side and yet, is an immensely popular song by the group. This b-side only appears on their repackaged album called Wings:<i><b>You Never Walk Alone</b></i> and has not left the Korean charts, the Gaon’s Digital Charts, since its release.</p>
            <p>These are some of the messages that have been incorporated into the song. Although it is a song missing someone who is far away, a tragic incident, they have not fully confirmed the song is about the Sewol Ferry disaster.</p>
            <p>Even if the group has not officially confirmed the meaning of the song, many already know what the song means. Yes, it is about a sad event, and yes it is about longing. Those two things are what the song is certainly about, as many have gone through personal hardships and see their struggles in the song. To understand that this song has the interpretations to be seen from a lens of a single tragic and traumatic event is all the confirmation we need for something that maybe, doesn’t need to be expressed in words but understood with the heart.</p>
